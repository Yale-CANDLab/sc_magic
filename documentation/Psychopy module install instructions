Psychopy manual install for MacOS 
Based off of instructions on Psychopy website (http://psychopy.org/installation.html), but with some important changes.
Note that Steps 5-6 are only necessary if you will be using a Labjack.

1. Install Homebrew, if you haven't already done so. The Homebrew website provides the necessary installation command.
2. Using Homebrew, install new, standalone versions of Python/Pip using the command "brew install python". Homebrew should 
automatically install Python version 2.7 and make this the default Python on your user account. To test this, run the 
commands "which python" and "which pip". The output should show that Python/pip are both located in 
/usr/local/bin, not /usr/bin.
2. WxPython
	Download the cocoa/python2.7 version of wxPython (link on Psychopy page)
	To install, temporarily change security settings in System Preferences (Security and Privacy) to allow apps 
	downloaded from "anywhere."
	If you don't do this, you'll get a message that the package is damaged when you try to open the installer
	When you finish installing WxPython, change your security settings back.
3. pyo 
	Run the following commands to install pyo prerequisites and then pyo itself.
		brew install liblo libsndfile portaudio portmidi --universal
		# cd into a suitable installation directory for pyo
		git clone https://github.com/belangeo/pyo.git
		cd pyo
		sudo python setup.py install --use-coreaudio --use-double
	If you get warnings/errors during the brew step, you may have to follow homebrew's advice and run some
	"force overwrite" link commmands.
4. Run the following commands to install Python modules
	pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas pyopengl pyglet pillow moviepy lxml openpyxl configobj psychopy
	pip install pyserial pyparallel
	(If either of these commands fail due to permissions errors, try re-running with sudo)
5. LabJackPython (make sure link is still correct, should be listed on Psychopy page)
	# cd into a good installation directory
	git clone https://github.com/labjack/LabJackPython
	cd LabJackPython
	sudo python setup.py install
	# Note: substitute "python" with the path given for Python in your local_config if you have a specific Python 
	version you want to use.
6. Labjack Exodriver
	Download the Exodriver pre-built installer from here: https://labjack.com/support/software/installers/exodriver
	Then, open the downloaded installer and follow instructions to install.

Two More Things:
The module should now be correctly installed, but you need to make sure that your Psychopy scripts use the correct audio driver (portaudio). If you build your scripts using the Builder interface of the Psychopy application, you need to change a setting in the application before generating your scripts. Go to Preferences (click the button with the screwdriver/wrench), and replace the contents of the audio driver field with the following: ['portaudio']

This is optional, but to stop the pointless "ApplePersistenceIgnoreState" message from appearing every time you run, execute the following command from the Terminal.
	defaults write org.python.python ApplePersistenceIgnoreState NO

Troubleshooting:
1. If you've done the above and you're getting an error related related to an "unknown encoding" in matplotlib, there's a known problem that sometimes appears on MacOS. The solution is to downgrade matplotlib to version 1.4.3 using pip, like this: "pip install version==1.4.3" (use sudo if you get a permissions error).
2. If you don't use Homebrew to get a local version of Python, you may experience problems where Exodriver cannot find the
libraries it needs to function. The only solution that has been found so far is to do the Homebrew installation.
