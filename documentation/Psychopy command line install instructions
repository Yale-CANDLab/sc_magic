Psychopy manual install for OS X / MacOS (based off of instructions on Psychopy website: http://psychopy.org/installation.html)

Note: Order for steps 1-3 doesn't matter, but steps 4-5 must come in order at the end

1. Pip (for installing python packages)
	Go to Pip website, download and then install pip (if you don't already have it)
2. WxPython
	Download the cocoa/python2.7 version of wxPython (link on Psychopy page)
	To install, temporarily change security settings in System Preferences (Security and Privacy) to allow apps downloaded from "anywhere"
	If you don't do this, you'll get a message that the package is damaged when you try to open the installer
	Change security settings back right after installing
3. pyo
	First, install homebrew. The homebrew website provides the necessary installation command.
	Then, run the following commands:
		brew install liblo libsndfile portaudio portmidi --universal
		# cd into a suitable installation directory for pyo
		git clone https://github.com/belangeo/pyo.git
		cd pyo
		sudo python setup.py install --use-coreaudio --use-double
	If you get warnings/errors during the brew step, you may have to follow homebrew's advice and run some "force overwrite" link commmands
4. Run the following commands to install Python modules
	sudo pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas pyopengl pyglet pillow moviepy lxml openpyxl configobj psychopy
	sudo pip install pyserial pyparallel
5. LabJackPython (make sure link is still correct, should be listed on Psychopy page)
	# cd into a good installation directory
	git clone https://github.com/labjack/LabJackPython
	cd LabJackPython
	sudo python setup.py install
