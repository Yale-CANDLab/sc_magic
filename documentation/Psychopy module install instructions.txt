Psychopy manual install for MacOS 
Based off of instructions on Psychopy website (http://psychopy.org/installation.html), but with some important changes.
Note that Steps 6-7 are only necessary if you will be using a Labjack.

1. Install Homebrew, if you haven't already done so. The Homebrew website provides the necessary installation command.
2. Using Homebrew, install new, standalone versions of Python/Pip using the command "brew install python". Homebrew should 
automatically install Python version 2.7 and make this the default Python on your user account. To test this, run the 
commands "which python" and "which pip". The output should show that Python/pip are both located in 
/usr/local/bin, not /usr/bin.
2. WxPython
	Download the cocoa/python2.7 version of wxPython (link on Psychopy page)
	To install, temporarily change security settings in System Preferences (Security and Privacy) to allow apps 
	downloaded from "anywhere."
	If you don't do this, you'll get a message that the package is damaged when you try to open the installer
	When you finish installing WxPython, change your security settings back.
3. pyo 
	Run the following commands to install pyo prerequisites and then pyo itself.
		brew install liblo libsndfile portaudio portmidi --universal
		# cd into a suitable installation directory for pyo
		git clone https://github.com/belangeo/pyo.git
		cd pyo
		sudo python setup.py install --use-coreaudio --use-double
	If you get warnings/errors during the brew step, you may have to follow homebrew's advice and run some
	"force overwrite" link commmands.
4. Run the following commands to install Python modules
	pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib pyopengl pyglet pillow moviepy lxml openpyxl configobj pyserial pyparallel psychopy
	(If this command fails due to permissions errors, try re-running with "sudo".)
5. For now, a module called "matplotlib" needs to be manually re-installed. From https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib/1.4.3, find
	the most recently uploaded Python wheel for matplotlib-1.4.3 that has "macosx" in its name. Download that file, and then run this:
		pip install [path to downloaded wheel]
		(If this fails due to a permissions error, re-run with "sudo")
6. LabJackPython (make sure link is still correct, should be listed on Psychopy page)
	# cd into a good installation directory
	git clone https://github.com/labjack/LabJackPython
	cd LabJackPython
	sudo python setup.py install
	# Note: substitute "python" with the path given for Python in your local_config if you have a specific Python 
	version you want to use.
7. Labjack Exodriver
	Download the Exodriver pre-built installer from here: https://labjack.com/support/software/installers/exodriver
	Then, open the downloaded installer and follow instructions to install.

Notes:
1. 	This is optional, but to stop a pointless "ApplePersistenceIgnoreState" message from appearing every time you run, execute the
	following command from the Terminal:
	defaults write org.python.python ApplePersistenceIgnoreState NO

2. 	The Psychopy module should now be correctly installed. However, if you are building your own scripts using the Psychopy 
	desktop application, you need to make sure that your Psychopy scripts use the correct audio driver (portaudio). Open your project's
	.psyexp file, go to Preferences (click the button with the screwdriver/wrench), and replace the contents of the audio driver field
	with the following, including brackets: ['portaudio']


Troubleshooting:
1. If you don't use Homebrew to get a local version of Python, you may experience problems where Exodriver cannot find the
libraries it needs to function. The only solution that has been found so far is to do the Homebrew installation.
