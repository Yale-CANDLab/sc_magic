If the computer doesn't have Python 3 installed, download and install the latest stable version.

Then, create a virtual environment called sc to use exclusively for the sc task.
If you haven't done this before, you should create a folder in safe, memorable place
where you will store all of your Python virtual environments, and then put your sc
environment there.

	cd [whatever directory you store virtual enviroments in]
	python3 -m venv sc
	source sc/bin/activate
	pip install psychopy LabJackPython pygame
	deactivate


If you haven't used LabJack before, you need to install a driver for it to work with your computer.
Download the Exodriver pre-built installer from here: https://labjack.com/support/software/installers/exodriver
Then, open the downloaded installer and follow instructions to install.


Whenever you want to run the task, start by activating the virtual environment: [path]/sc/bin/activate
When you're finished, run "deactivate" (or just close the Terminal window).

Last thing: To use the wrapper script, which builds the task run commands for you, you need to create a config file 
in the main directory of the repository. See the local_config template for the formatting.
